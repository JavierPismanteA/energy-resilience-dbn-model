# Dynamic Bayesian Network Model for Energy Resilience Assessment
This repository presents a Python-based model that uses Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) to analyze and simulate the resilience of energy systems under a wide range of external and internal stressors. The model allows for the probabilistic evaluation of cascading failures across interconnected components such as maritime terminals, substations, distribution lines, and energy consumers.

A key component of this project is the use of pyAgrum which enables efficient construction, inference, and manipulation of dynamic probabilistic graphical models.
